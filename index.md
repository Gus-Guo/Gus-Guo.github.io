## About Me

I obtained my master degree from National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science in 2020. Before that, I received my bachelor degree in South China University of Technology in 2017.

My research interests focus on object detection in images, videos and point clouds.

### News

* We release a new point cloud based object detction codebase [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet)!
* We win the 1st place among all lidar-only methods on three tasks of 3D Object Detection, 3D Object Tracking and 3D Domain Adaption in Waymo Open Challenge!
* Two papers are accepted by CVPR2020!
* One papers are accepted by ICCV2019!
* We win the 3rd place on Instance Segmentation, 2nd place on Panoptic Segmentation in MS COCO2018! Our team are invited to ECCV2018 to give a talk.
