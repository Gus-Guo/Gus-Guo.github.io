## About Me 

I am an algorithm engineer in TikTok currently, focus on content understanding/generation x recommendation, image and video generation. Previously I worked in Alimama, Alibaba Group, working on personal creative recommendation, creation of advertisement creatives, especially in types of videos. I received my master degree from National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science in 2020. Before that, I received my bachelor degree in South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2017.

My research interests focus on content understanding/generation x recommendation, large language model. 

### News
* We release [PV-RCNN++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00463.pdf)!
* We release a new point cloud based object detction codebase [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet)! OpenPCDet contains multiple SOTA models including SECOND, PointPillar, PartA^2 and PV-RCNN. New models are on our plan. 
* We win the **1st place** among all lidar-only methods on three tasks of 3D Object Detection, 3D Object Tracking and 3D Domain Adaption in Waymo Open Challenge!
* Two papers are accepted by CVPR2020!
* One paper is accepted by ICCV2019!
* We win the **3rd place** on Instance Segmentation, **2nd place** on Panoptic Segmentation in MS COCO2018! Our team is invited to ECCV2018 to give a talk.
